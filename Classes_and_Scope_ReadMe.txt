---Classes---
	Classes are, as the video describes, like a factory that produces the containers that will store information.  Everytime a new cs file is made a class is associated
with it.  The class must share the same name as the file it is in.  Classes are a way to break up tasks so they are much easier to handle.  If I were to make a character
that had a number of different actions and abilities, it would be beneficial to try and break these up into classes.  Classes can be used to instance a new object.  A cunstructor
is required to do this. The constructor is a method that shares the same name as the class.  It has no return type.  The consturctor can have no parameters or can have as many
parameters as needed.  The constructor that will get used is the one that matches the parameters put in the constructor call, so it is good to make sure that a constructor has
been defined with the parameters desired.

---Scope and Access Modifiers---
	Scope is the area in which a variable or function can be seen and accessed within the code.  The access modifiers determine if the variable or function can be seen outside
the class in which they are in.  The private access modifier means that on the class or function can see the variable or function.  The public modifier means that anything can see
the variable or functions.  C# sets any variables or functions without a modifier to private by default.
