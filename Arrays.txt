An array is a set of elements with the same type.  Arrays are initialised by the type of data in the array followed by square brackets, like so: int[] myData.
After this the exact elements of the array my be listed in curly braces: int[] myData = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.  Alternately, the array can be be initialised as a new array
and the length of the array specified: int[] myData = new int[6].  Either way the length of the array must be stated.  The first method gives the length with how many pieces
of data were put into the array.  When accessing elements from an array the array name is used followed by the index in square brackets: myData[3].  The first index is 1 and
the last index is the length of the array minus 1.
