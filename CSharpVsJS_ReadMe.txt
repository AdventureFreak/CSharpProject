---Syntax and Conventions---
	Syntax is simply the way in which code is written.  Conventions are specific aspects of syntax that are important to use.  The dot operator or "." is one such.
It is used to access things inside of objects.  It's kind of like an address as the video puts it.  Another convention is the semicolon.  A semicolon must be placed at
the end of each line of code.  Curly braces are used to create blocks of code.  Everything within the braces are separate from the things outside of them... technically.

---C# vs JS---
	The syntax in C# differs from that of JS in many different ways.  In C# the class declaration must be made in the class file.  In JS the class declaration is
hidden.  In C# variables are declared by indicating what type the variable is and then giving it a name.  In JS the keyword var is used.  If the strict setting is in
effect the variable name must be followed by a colon and then the type of variable it is.  In C# functions are declared by stating the return type.  This is followed
by the name of the function, a list of arguments in parenthesis, and then the actual function in curly braces.  In JS a function is declared with the key word function.  
The arguments come after the name, and the return type comes after the arguments with a colon in front.
